<h2>What is PhenQ Supplement?</h2>
<p>PhenQ is advertised as “five powerful weight loss pills in one” and it is one of the best weight loss supplements available on the market that contains natural ingredients which are proven to prevent fat production and reduce calorie intake, resulting in reduced excess body weight. The company has more than 190,000 customers who claim that it has incredible weight loss benefits.</p>
<p>The PhenQ weight loss supplement that comes in the form of a diet pill is sold on its official website <a href="https://caew.info/phenq-meal-shake">PhenQ.com</a>. Just so we are clear, PhenQ supplement does not contain phentermine, an illegal weight loss ingredient which is banned by the FDA.</p>
<p>A person can easily boost the weight loss process by taking two capsules of PhenQ daily; it will boost their mood and energy levels, burn body fat, and suppress appetite. PhenQ is made with the combination of multiple diet pills in a well formulated manner which brings the benefits of all these five ingredients in one convenient capsule.</p>
<p>PhenQ is a powerful fat burner that shows amazing results, and it has capsicum, piperine, caffeine and other ingredients. One can get the complete ingredients list on its official website <a href="https://caew.info/phenq-meal-shake">PhenQ.com</a>.</p>
<p>PhenQ supplement is a dietary supplement that is focused on weight loss to overcome the rising issue of obesity. PhenQ fat burner is a metabolic booster that helps in losing body fat faster, preventing the formation of new fat cells and limiting hunger pangs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We strongly encourage <a href="https://caew.info/phenq">buying PhenQ from only the official website</a> since products claiming to be PhenQ on other websites may not be legitimate.</p>
<h3>About the Makers of PhenQ</h3>
<p>WOLFSON BRANDS (UK) LIMITED is a leading supplement manufacturer and it has become a trusted name because of its ultimate weight loss supplement PhenQ which gained popularity during the pandemic. The company has its headquarters in Glasgow, Scotland, and an office in South Portland, Maine.</p>
<p>It offers high-quality dietary supplements that are manufactured with 100% authenticity and effective ingredients in a well-formulated way that will help the consumers to achieve their ideal body weight in less time.</p>
<p>They have an experienced team of nutrition experts, fitness professionals and health consultants who are ready to help you at each and every step to reach your goal.</p>
<h3>How does PhenQ Work?</h3>
<p>PhenQ diet pills are not just your ordinary run-of-the-mill weight loss pills that do nothing but suppress hunger. PhenQ works to burn fat with its revolutionary ingredient, α-Lacys Reset (in conjunction with other ingredients). The ingredients in PhenQ boost your metabolism and increase thermogenesis – the two effects compound on each other and accelerate the fat burning process.</p>
<p>The ingredients in PhenQ such as piperine put a halt on fat production and calorie intake altogether. This prevents fat from depositing in your body again. The supplement helps in keeping new adipose tissues from forming where the old tissue has already burnt away. What does this translate to? Easy: You do not need to worry about gaining unexplained fat and losing out on all the progress you made in your journey.</p>
<p>Ingredients such as calcium carbonate, Nopal fiber, and carnitine fumarate curb appetite and lower hunger pangs for unhealthy food, the primary cause of unhealthy weight gain.</p>
<p>PhenQ is not a revolutionary breakthrough without a reason. Above all this, it also improves the energy levels, so that you can sweat it out on that treadmill longer than usual. The energy to work out more will boost up the whole process of cutting down a few pounds and getting in shape.</p>
<h2>Core Ingredients in PhenQ</h2>
<p>Core Ingredients in PhenQ IMAGE</p>
<p><a href="https://caew.info/phenq">PhenQ diet pills are made of all natural ingredients</a>, thus providing a superior option to the ordinary ‘hoaxes’ containing numerous filler chemicals marketed for weight loss.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Although PhenQ sounds like a dietary supplement that should be containing phentermine owing to the name ‘Phen’Q, it does not. Since you require a prescription to be able to buy products containing phentermine, no dietary weight loss supplement includes phentermine in its ingredient list.</p>
<p>Here is a list of ingredients that in PhenQ provide you with the perfect support to lose fat:</p>
<h3>α-Lacys Reset</h3>
<p>α-Lacys Reset is the star ingredient of PhenQ, or should we say the magic wand that gives you far superior fat-busting results – a combination of Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Cysteine Base, and Magnesium. The mechanism of losing weight is simple and coherent: burning more calories than you consume. And, how do you burn calories? With a fast metabolism.</p>
<p>This is exactly what α-Lacys Reset targets – to rev up your metabolism and accelerate fat burning process. If you have some ‘really’ stubborn fat in the most unwanted parts of your body, α-Lacys Reset in PhenQ can help shift it quickly.</p>
<p>Wait till it gets better: a faster metabolism is directly related to an increase in thermogenesis. We shall avoid the old road of boring scientific explanation; in simple words, an increase in thermogenesis means an increase in the body’s heat production.</p>
<p>When the body generates more heat, it burns more calories. Thus, α-Lacys Reset with alpha lipoic acid, accelerates fat burning in two dimensions. This fires up your calorie burn rate to make the unwanted fat go away while helping you achieve the desired body weight.</p>
<h3>Capsimax Powder</h3>
<p>Capsimax powder contains a blend of ingredients like capsicum, piperine, caffeine, and niacin (vitamin B3), in a well proportioned quantity which makes it ideal for burning stored body fat. The thermogenic properties of capsicum pepper plant and piperine work together to turn up your body heat and lose fat.</p>
<p>The weight loss benefits of capsicum are proven and demonstrated, in multiple studies; it was found that it can significantly burn stored body fat and help in weight loss. Fat burning will increase weight loss, but it will also increase fatigue and hunger, and then the other appetite suppressant and energy boosting ingredients like caffeine come into play.</p>
<p>The Capsimax powder has vitamin B3 in it that helps to increase the release of adiponectin, a weight loss hormone secreted by fat cells. The effect of Vitamin B3 or Niacin, can be boosted by taking a walk or exercise. PhenQ diet pill is an advanced organic supplement that contains piperine, niacin and capsicum which altogether helps to lose excess weight faster.</p>
<p>Piperine in Capsimax has thermogenic properties that significantly raises the body heat which leads to fat burn and helps to gain lean muscle mass. Piperine also prevents the formation of new adipose tissue cells and regulates obesity – induced dyslipidemia. It also prevents the formation of new fat cells in the body.</p>
<h3>Chromium Picolinate</h3>
<p>Chromium Picolinate is a natural mineral that can be found in meat, vegetables and whole grains; it effectively controls the blood sugar levels by limiting your sugar and carb cravings.</p>
<p>Sugar from the foods is absorbed in the blood and carried to the cells to use it for energy. But when we have enough sugar we stop craving it. What Chromium Picolinate does is that it allows the cells to take in the optimum sugar from the food which limits the carb and sugar cravings that ultimately helps in losing a few pounds.</p>
<p>It is often found that people with diabetes take chromium picolinate because it helps to regulate their blood sugar levels and curb sugar cravings.</p>
<h3>Caffeine</h3>
<p>Caffeine can provide instant energy, increase focus and alertness which is why it is found in most of the weight loss supplements as well as energy drinks. It is a hunger suppressant that increases thermogenesis to boost the fat burn. It can significantly improve your performance and help to get more out of your regular exercises, further aid in burning fat and support weight loss efforts.</p>
<h3>Nopal</h3>
<p>Nopal cactus is a great source of essential amino acids which provide you with optimum energy when needed during your workout sessions. It helps to flush fluids from the tissue into the bloodstream which helps to reduce body weight caused by fluid retention.</p>
<p>Nopal is high in fibers which makes it ideal to gain control over hunger; it is excellent for appetite suppression. It has plentiful benefits to maintain good health other than helping in weight loss.</p>
<p>It has low calories in it therefore it can be included in a weight – loss strategy. It has high fiber which can suppress hunger, and the fibers also help to reduce excess weight gain caused due to fluid retention. The amino acids in it provide you with energy to power your workout and exercises in a natural and healthy way.</p>
<h3>L-Carnitine Fumarate</h3>
<p>L-Carnitine is an important naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a fat burner. Red meat, nuts, dairy products, and vegetables are some good sources of l-carnitine. This protein not only burns fat but also provides energy to fight fatigue caused due to dieting.</p>
<p>L-carnitine helps the carnitine acetyltransferase to transport the fatty acids in the cells to the body, so that energy can be produced by burning the fatty acids. But lack of l-carnitine can slow down the fat burning process. If you are supplementing your diet with PhenQ then it will boost the amino acids and its health benefits.</p>
<h2>Servings</h2>
<p><a href="https://caew.info/phenq">Simply take one PhenQ pill with your breakfast and one with your lunch</a>. Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Because PhenQ contains caffeine and other ingredients formulated to increase your energy levels, we do not recommend you take PhenQ after 3pm. so as to avoid interrupting your sleeping patterns. If you are sensitive to caffeine we recommend you limit your intake of coffee and other caffeine-containing beverages while using PhenQ.</p>
<p>The suggested serving of PhenQ pill is one capsule with breakfast and another pill with lunch. This translates to a total serving of two per day. Since PhenQ is formulated with energy boosting ingredients, it is recommended to avoid consuming PhenQ after 3 p.m. since it can potentially avoid your sleeping patterns by spiking up your energy levels through the ceiling.</p>
<h2>Dosage</h2>
<p>PhenQ includes ingredients in their clinically safe and effective dosages. Surprisingly, each serving of PhenQ has about 100 mg of caffeine which is the same amount as in a cup of coffee. Apart from caffeine, it contains 230mg of calcium carbonate, 150mg of L-carnitine, 80mcg of chromium picolinate, 50mg of the Capsimax powder, 25mg of α-Lacys Reset, and 20mg of Nopal fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Since PhenQ contains 100 mg of caffeine, we recommend abandoning that much-yearned morning cup of coffee (or any other caffeinated beverages/ dietary supplement) if you are caffeine sensitive.</strong></p>
<h2>Pricing of PhenQ</h2>
<p>When it comes to pricing, PhenQ is competitively aligned with most other supplements that target burning fat. One bottle of PhenQ costs <strong>$70 USD</strong>, containing 60 pills (2 pills per serving) which means each serving of PhenQ costs <strong>$2.33 USD</strong>. If you are ordering from anywhere outside the U.S. or U.K. are worried about the hefty shipping charges, PhenQ has you covered. They provide free-shipping on all subscriptions worldwide (<em>yes, that’s right!).</em></p>
<p>If you wanna cut down on the price, it is ideal to buy a 3-month subscription which costs <strong>$139.90 USD </strong>(includes free shipping). This means you will be paying only <strong>$46.63 USD </strong>per bottle, saving $99 USD on the whole order.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to detoxify and cleanse your body off of harmful toxins, you can buy the 3 Bottles + 2 Advana Cleanse Bottles bundle which will cost you <strong>$189.95 + Free Worldwide Shipping</strong>. This bundle can help you save <strong>$209.90</strong> USD.</p>
<p><em>So, go buy those gym gears you wanted (with all the money you just saved) and hit the gym!</em></p>
<p>We can not stress enough on the importance of <a href="https://caew.info/phenq">buying PhenQ from the official website</a> since WOLFSON BRANDS (UK) LIMITED is the only legit supplier (and maker) of PhenQ pills. If you are buying PhenQ from other e-Commerce stores such as Amazon, Walmart, etc., there are high chances that the product being sold is duplicitous in nature and not authorized to sell.</p>

<h2>Review of PhenQ – Does it Work or Is it a Hoax?</h2>
<p>Losing weight has become one of those new year resolutions that mostly never meet their ending – partly because people either make unrealistic weight loss goals or give up in the middle, losing all their gains. The latter can be blamed on lack of motivation and little to no results even after religiously working out.</p>
<p><a href="https://caew.info/phenq">With the PhenQ supplement</a>, the fat burning process gets easier. Since it works in 5 scientific and safe ways to not just shred fat but also avoid fat accumulation, this fat burner can perfectly complement your exercise routine. Made in a Food and Drug Administration approved facility, the PhenQ supplement does not just burn fat but also prevents you from gaining more by curbing unhealthy food cravings.</p>
<p>Below we have broken down the PhenQ reviews in multiple parts so that it is easy to leaf through and decide for yourself if the PhenQ supplement works or if it is a hoax.</p>
<p><em>Hint: It is certainly not a hoax. Read on to know why.</em></p>
<h3>Benefits of PhenQ Fat Burner</h3>
<p>Not only is PhenQ nominally priced, but also takes anyone by surprise with its long list of benefits and perks imparted by its natural ingredients. Below, we have highlighted the benefits of this ‘state-of-the-art’ supplement:</p>
<h4>Shreds down fat naturally</h4>
<p>PhenQ with its effective and natural ingredients fires up the body’s metabolism and increases thermogenesis, the conjunction of which helps the individual cut down on the extra body fat.</p>
<h4>Halts fat-building mechanisms</h4>
<p>Let’s face it: Fat accumulation in the parts of your body from where you just lost fat can be insanely frustrating and demotivating. PhenQ tackles this issue by putting a break on fat-building mechanisms altogether.</p>
<h4>Lowers hunger pangs and suppresses appetite</h4>
<p>Do you, at times, crave a cheesy slice of pizza and then, defeated by your hunger pang, end up ordering one? <em>There goes the progress you made today!</em></p>
<p>The makers of PhenQ realize the problem today’s youth faces – the inclination towards unhealthy food. This is why the excipients in PhenQ also work on appetite suppression. To suppress appetite, the supplement uses Nopal Cactus fiber, carnitine fumarate, piperine, etc. This decreases the total caloric intake and thus, your body has to work less on burning the unhealthy calories that you would otherwise consume.</p>
<h4>Revs up the energy levels</h4>
<p>Are you on your fourth cup of coffee, already wishing the day was over and you could just sit on your couch, lazing out? You need to work on improving your energy levels. Fortunately, PhenQ and its natural ingredients can help you achieve the same. It is not just a weight loss supplement that works to shred down fat and curb appetite; PhenQ also provides great energy support so you could last longer in your workout sessions.</p>
<h4>Improves mood</h4>
<p>The process of losing weight often brings with it the feelings of depression while negatively impacting mood and energy levels. PhenQ does not just boost metabolism to support your exercise routine, but also improves mood and energy levels keeping you en route to your goal, i.e., to lose weight.</p>
<h4>60-Day Money Back Guarantee</h4>
<p><em>Wait… Am I backed by a 60-day money back guarantee too?</em></p>
<p>What other reason do you need to invest into a product? At the end of 2 months, if you look at yourself in the mirror and think you did not lose weight, PhenQ will return every single penny of your investment without asking any questions.</p>
<p>If you are not content with the results, you can simply return the first two empty bottles of your 60-day supply of PhenQ and any unopened bottles within 67 days of receiving your first order. To redeem your 60-day money back guarantee, all you have to do is contact their elite customer service team on <strong>support@phenq.com</strong>.</p>
<h3>Transparency of PhenQ</h3>
<p>Most weight loss supplements with their ‘innovative and discounted’ formula will promise you the moon but when it comes to disclosing the ingredients used, they will back out.</p>
<p>With so much ambiguity surrounding the weight loss industry, it feels like a fresh breath of air when a brand is absolutely transparent with its practices and ingredients. <a href="https://caew.info/phenq">PhenQ is no different</a>.</p>
<p>PhenQ diet pills maintain transparency and safe manufacturing practices to the hilt. The product is manufactured in a Food and Drug Administration approved facility and maintains rigorous quality practices to ensure the product’s safety and efficacy.</p>
<h3>Customer Reviews and Testimonials</h3>
<p>PhenQ has stellar customer reviews. An extensive list of people who have lost weight swear by the PhenQ weight loss supplement for their achievements.</p>

<h3>Side Effects and Risks</h3>
<p>When you are on a weight loss journey, it is important to use supplements that are safe. We thoroughly scrutinized every aspect of PhenQ’s diet pills to check if they have any side effects. Although there are usually no side effects to these diet pills, a miniscule percentage of users reported symptoms of nausea, headache, dizziness, and an upset stomach.</p>
<p>The intensity of these side effects was, however, negligible, as per the users.</p>
<p>It is ideal to avoid stimulating foods or drinks, especially those that are highly caffeinated. It is possible that the pills could interfere with birth control pills, thus, it is best not to use both simultaneously.</p>
